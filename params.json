Open source software has revolutionized many industries, but food remains stuck in the past. Overpriced proprietary hardware and software continues to dominate the industry. It just doesn't make sense. Spend less and grow more with AgWe.\r\n\r\n### The first stage of the AgWe project is simple. Baby steps, right?\r\n\r\n1.Create lightweight software to run on readily available microcontroller platforms that will expose climate data via Websockets. Target controllers include:\r\n* [Tessel 2](https://tessel.io/) via [agwe-tessel](https://github.com/ProZachJ/agwe-tessel)\r\n* [Raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)\r\n* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)\r\n* [Espruino](http://www.espruino.com/)\r\n* [Intel Edison](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html)\r\n\r\n...there are many more...we'd love contributions\r\n\r\n2.Build a cross platform controller software that can discover, connect to the microcontrollers, store, and visualize the data.\r\n",
